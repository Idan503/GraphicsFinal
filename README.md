# GraphicsFinal
Computer Graphics course final project.  

Made using OpenGL-glut, writter in C++.  

### A Brief Overview
This project generates a random terrain, based on a combination of seismological and random terrain generation algorithms.  
In the center of the terrain, there is a bridge, while the train repeatedly moves on it on top of realistic-textured rails.  
When the camera gets close to the train we can also hear a real engine sound effect.  
The curvature of the bridge is based on a combination of math trigonometric functions.
